![The folders will be created](images/folders.png)<br/>
### STEP 02: <br/> 
Right-click in folder called 'usecase' (Don't worry, we use regex to identify any folder with usecase in the name to show this menu option!) then click "Clean Arch Scaffolding.: New usecase".<br/> 
![Clean Arch Scaffolding > New Feature](images/menu_usecase.png)<br/>

If the my templates folder does not exist, a dialog will open asking you to download some examples from the web.<br />
Click Yes and the folder will be created with the templates inside.

![Create templates](images/create_templates.png)<br/>

Try again and repeat this last step.
A dialog will appear asking for your use case name.

![usecase name](images/usecase_name.png)<br/>

The source files will be created in accord with templates in folder ".my_templates" of your project: <br/>
![Folder template](images/templates_folder.png)<br/>

You can write the template file using special keywords.<br/>
Look this sample:<br/>
![Template file](images/template_file.png)<br/>

#### Write your own templates and put in your repository. Use your template in any project. Just set with your repository properties:
![Repo options](images/repo_options.png)<br/>

### Settings:
If you want to adapt the template, go to the extension settings and edit the json with the templates.<br/>
![Like this default settings](images/settings.png)<br/>

#### You can use this special keywords to indicates some locations:<br/>
- **{{package_name}}** to get name of your package in pubspec.yaml file;<br/>
- **{{root_folder}}** to first folder of your projetc;<br/>
- **{{custom_folder}}** to clicked folder;<br/>
- **{{feature_name}}** to use the given custom name;<br/>
- **{{usecase_name}}** to use a given usecase name;<br/>

#### And you can associate this keywords with this format pattern too as given below:
- **{{usecase_name.lowerCase}}** to use a given usecase name with lowercase pattern;<br/>
- **{{usecase_name.upperCase}}** to use a given usecase name with UPPERCASE pattern;<br/>  
- **{{usecase_name.snakeCase}}** to use a given usecase name with snake_case pattern (indicate to file path names);<br/>
- **{{usecase_name.pascalCase}}** to use a given usecase name with PascalCase pattern (indicate to Class names);<br/>
- **{{usecase_name.camelCase}}**  to use a given usecase name with camelCase pattern (indicate to variables names).<br/>

**Ex. 01 (Template file):** '{{custom_folder}}/{{feature_name}}/domain/usecases/{{usecase_name.snakeCase}}.template' 

**Ex. 02 (Folder only):** '{{custom_folder}}/{{feature_name}}/domain/entities/' 
> Attention: <br/>
